# Data-Analysis-Visualization-of-Nipah-Virsus

This project involves extensive data collection on the Nipah virus, documented in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed using Python for visual representation. By creating dynamic graphs and charts, it enhances the comprehension of trends, patterns, and relationships within the Nipah virus data. This project aims to advance public health and scientific research by enabling effective data visualization for swift interpretation of key findings. 

Provided Dataset details the incidence of Nipah virus across various countries, emphasizing hotspot regions and cataloging yearly cases for predictive analysis using linear regression. This forecast aids in proactive measures and resource allocation.

Aditionally, Research on bat species associated with Nipah virus transmission is crucial for understanding and mitigating the spread of the virus. RNA data from various mammals has been gathered to identify the RNA mean of the most affected amino acid codons. This analysis helps visualize trends in RNA mean values, providing insights into common genetic variations among mammals concerning these codons.
